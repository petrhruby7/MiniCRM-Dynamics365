**REQ-004: Manager Approval Field Visibility Logic**
*Business Context:*
High-value orders (above 10,000 CZK) require manager approval before processing. The Manager Approval field should only be visible for orders that require approval to maintain clean UI and prevent unnecessary data entry.

*Functional Requirements:*
Show Manager Approval field when Order Amount > 10,000 CZK
Hide Manager Approval field when Order Amount ≤ 10,000 CZK
Clear Manager Approval value when field becomes hidden
Apply logic on form load and amount field changes
Handle null/empty amount values gracefully

*Technical Requirements:*
OnLoad event handler for initial field visibility
OnChange event handler for Amount field
Dynamic field visibility using setVisible() method
Clear field value when hiding to prevent data inconsistencies
Handle currency field type and potential null values

*UI Behavior:*
Smooth show/hide transition without form refresh
Field appears in same location when shown
No visual artifacts during visibility changes
Consistent behavior across different form types (create/update)

*Edge Cases:*
Amount field cleared/null - hide approval field
Amount exactly equals 10,000 - hide approval field (≤ threshold)
Form load with pre-existing high amount - show approval field
Currency conversion scenarios (if multi-currency enabled)

*Acceptance Criteria:*
Manager Approval field visible only when Amount > 10,000 CZK
Field hidden immediately when Amount drops to ≤ 10,000 CZK
Manager Approval value cleared when field hidden
Logic works on both create and update forms
No JavaScript errors in browser console


**REQ-005: Dynamic Order Status Management**

*Business Context:*
Order status must follow the approval workflow, preventing invalid transitions and keeping consistency with Manager Approval.

*Functional Requirements:*
The system must always display the core statuses Draft, In Progress, and Cancelled. 
The option Waiting for Approval is shown only when the Manager Approval field is visible and equals No or null. 
When Manager Approval is set to Yes, the option Approved becomes available and the user is prompted to confirm auto-setting the status to Approved. 
The Completed status is never shown, as it is handled separately by REQ-006. 
If the status changes from Approved to any other value, the Manager Approval field is automatically reset to No.

*Technical Requirements:*
On form load, status options must be initialized. 
Changes to Manager Approval must dynamically update the available options and handle the auto-approval confirmation. 
Changes to Order Status must trigger resetManagerApprovalOnStatusChange to keep values consistent. 
Status option handling is implemented using addOption and removeOption, and integrates with the Manager Approval visibility logic (REQ-004).

*Acceptance Criteria:*
Core statuses are always available. 
Waiting for Approval is displayed only for high-value orders without approval. 
Approved requires Manager Approval = Yes and user confirmation. 
Completed is never displayed. 
When status is changed away from Approved, Manager Approval is reset to No.
