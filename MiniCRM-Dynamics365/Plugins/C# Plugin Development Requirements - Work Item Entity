**REQ-006: Work Item Auto-Completion Plugin**
*Business Context:*
When all Work Items within an Order are completed, the Order should automatically transition to "Completed" status to streamline project closure and eliminate manual status management overhead.

*Functional Requirements:*
Monitor Work Item status changes to "Completed"
Query all Work Items for the parent Order
Automatically set Order status to "Completed" when all Work Items finished
Only trigger on Work Item updates, not creates or deletes
Handle edge cases (Orders with no Work Items, mixed statuses)

*Technical Requirements:*
Plugin registration: Post-Operation, Update message, Work Item entity
Execute after Work Item status change is committed to database
Query parent Order and all related Work Items
Validate all Work Items have Status = "Completed" (100000002)
Update parent Order Status to "Completed" if validation passes
Use efficient querying to minimize performance impact

*Query Logic:*
Get parent Order ID from updated Work Item
Query all Work Items where Order = parent Order ID
Count Work Items where Status â‰  "Completed"
If count = 0, update Order Status to "Completed"

*Error Handling:*
Log all processing attempts and outcomes
Handle missing parent Order gracefully
Prevent infinite loops (Order update triggering Work Item updates)
Throw exceptions only for critical system failures
Continue processing if Order update fails (don't block Work Item save)

*Performance Considerations:*
Single query to check all Work Items per Order
Minimize database round trips
Execute only when Work Item status actually changed
Efficient filtering to avoid unnecessary processing

*Acceptance Criteria:*
Order automatically becomes "Completed" when last Work Item completed
No manual Order status management required
Works correctly with concurrent Work Item updates
No performance degradation on Work Item operations
Proper logging for audit and troubleshooting
